// [!] Create some variables to reference page elements, you'll need them later.
// Specifically: The dialog, the contribution button, the form, and the contributions list

// [!] Now, add a "click" event listener for the contribution button so that the dialog shows on click
// Here's how you can open a dialog as a modal: <dialogElement>.showModal();

// [!] Last thing, add a "submit" event listener for the form so that you can add the submitted info to the page
// Here's how you can get the submitted form data: const formData = new FormData(form); And to access a specific input, formData.get("<inputName>");
// Then, reset the form and close the dialog, adding a new element with the submitted info the page at the same time.
